This is an independant blog from my Graphic Novel career, and focused more on artificial intelligence development. Because of this, this will focus more on my adventures in learning more detailed things in Ruby, Python, Shell, and C++. Some portions about web development might come up. However, this will also include commentary on my unpleasant experiences when dealing with other people in the industry, so it will also function as a personal blog. If I make videos of these, I might make them peertube videos, as I find it easier to promote myself on that platform instead of youtube.

In one of my posts, I will go over how to set up a Gitea instance on Linux, and make it publicly available through Ngrok. I still plan on getting into developing human like robotics, but this will be on the backburner, while I work on producing a digital assistant that is more relevant to the creative sequential art field that I'm going into through Comicsgate. There are certain specifics to developing a personal assistant for brand and website management that are unique to it, that may not necessarily carry over into Synths, Social Robots, or whatever else you want to call them.
